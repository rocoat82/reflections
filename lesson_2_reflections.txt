How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory
It's a directory filled by files that are tracked by Git or could be, adding them to the Staging Area 

Staging Area
Place where to add a copy of some files from working directory,
that logically must be committed on Repository

Repository
Place where project files are stored with their history.
They could not yet be shared between different project developers
because are not pushed on the server but are only present locally on your
branch "master"

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If you have multiple files changed but you want only to commit a subset of them per logical change, adding only the interesed files to Staging Area and comparing it with the Repository content (git diff --staged), is possible to double-check the changes before the commit, ommitting the other changes reletive to other logical commits
