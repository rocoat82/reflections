How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory
It is only a simple contenitor of files to work on, but it doesn't tracks nothing

Staging Area
It's the place where files are added and where start to be tracked, but
until files in these area aren't commited, tey cannot be shared with other project's developers

Repository
Place where project files are stored with their history and could be shared between different project developers
